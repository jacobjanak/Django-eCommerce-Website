      Jane Doe was born and raised in the Czech Republic and now lives with
      her husband and daughter in Portland, Oregon. She began working in ceramics in 2009.
      <br /><br />
      Jane’s work is grounded in both functionality and design, and she enjoys making pieces for
      everyday use that are pleasing to the eye. She works in small batches, creating each
      one-of-a-kind piece by hand in her home studio using a potter’s wheel and hand building
      techniques. She uses primarily porcelain, and frequently integrates ilmenite, a mineral that she
      collects at the Oregon coast. Jane appreciates the tangible nature of ceramics, and takes
      inspiration from the beauty of the nature and everyday life.
